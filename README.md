Reasons to use Interfaces: in large apps where components need to interact with each other in a loosely coupled manner, incerfaces help decouple code by reducing dependencies.
1) Decoupling Code 
2) Enhancing Testability 

Use interfaces when you want to decouple the implementation details from the interface contract.

interfaces helps decouple the implementation details from the interface contract by creating a clear boundary between:

->What the system does (the contract/interface)

Defines the methods and properties that a class must implement.
Focuses on "what to do" rather than "how to do it."

->How the system does it (the implementation)

The actual code logic that fulfills the contract defined by the interface.
Focuses on "how to achieve the required functionality."
